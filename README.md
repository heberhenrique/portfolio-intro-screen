# 💾 portfolio-intro-screen

A retro-inspired terminal splash screen for Heber's portfolio, simulating a 1980s-style DOS boot sequence.

Built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this screen provides an animated experience that mimics an old-school bootloader with a typing cursor, progress bar, and "ACCESS GRANTED" sequence.
